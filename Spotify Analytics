--With this project, I was able to download data regarding Spotify from Kaggle.
--With these data, I created a table to insert the information into.
--With the mentioned table, I then performed analytics with the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--I was able to insert the Spotify Data .csv into the table from above.

--Then I looked into different aspects of the data using the SQL below.

--Which song has the longest duration?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--OR

SELECT MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Who are the top 10 artist by popularity?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

--Who are the bottom 10 artist by popularity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average duration for all the songs?

SELECT avg(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Which songs have a popularity over 90 and tempo over 160?

SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
AND tempo >160;

--Calculate the average popularity for the artist in the Spotify data table.  
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name,
their average popularity, and label them as a "Top Star".

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG( s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s
GROuP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >=90;
